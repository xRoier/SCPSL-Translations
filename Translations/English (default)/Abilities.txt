Ability Not Found:The ability ID associated with this ability does not exist.
Sprint:Increases your movement speed, but also increases sound made while moving.
Sneak:Your movements become silent, at the cost of a lot of speed.

Armed & Dangerous:You have consigned a Light Machine Gun, a Hacking Tool (access card), and a First-Aid Kit.

Pocket Dimension:Captures a human and teleports them to a pocket dimension that quickly kills them. Humans must choose the correct exit, or die.
Scopophobia:You stay docile and quiet most of the time - but you don't like being hurt, or having your face seen. Once you've been seen or hurt, quell your rage by killing transgressors. Follow their light before your fury subsides. The indignity of each offender adds to your AHP, preventing harm to you as long as it stands.
Try Not To Cry (Docile):It's too hard. Leaning on a door helps; you become quieter and stand in place against it, calming yourself down... or waiting for someone to come through.
Melee Attack (Rage):Usually, you keep to yourself. But when you're provoked... you'll tear through anything in your way to get to those who've hurt you. You destroy both doors and bodies in an area in front of you with your swings.
Ultrasensitive:You can't see humans unless they run, bump you, or fire a weapon in close proximity to you.

Tesla Overcharge:You can activate a Tesla Gate for 50 AP to instantly trigger it, killing any players in or near it.
Lockdown:Starting at Access Level 3, you can interact with some rooms to lock them down, shutting off all lights and closing all doors. While in locked down rooms, humans can't see SCP-173.

Neck Snap:Hold or click to snap a human's neck, instantly killing them as long as they can't see you or are blinking.
Charge (Rage):Cut their escapes short - they deserve it. You bolt straight ahead, demolishing anything in front of you for a range. If you hit a heavy gate, you force yourself through it.
