# SCPSL Translations   
This repo is used by Northwood Studios for hosting and managing translations for the game *SCP: Secret Laboratory*.   

We kindly ask that contributors:
* Do **not** submit a language that already exists.
  * In the case where a bad/faulty translation of your chosen language already exists, we ask you to amend the current existing one, rather than adding another duplicate language.
* Do **not** submit a made-up/joke language.
* Do **not** remove contributers from the contributors file.
* Only edit one language at a time

__Please follow these rules, as well as the guidelines in the Pull Request template when contributing to this repo__

# How to contribute
*Before contributing, a GitHub account is required - you can sign up for one [here](https://github.com/join). If you wish to contribute from your desktop (i.e. using a local text editor), a Git client is required. We recommend [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/), which provides a GUI and is easier for novice users to use. However, any Git client will work - it is ultimately a matter of personal preference. For help with GitHub Desktop, refer to [the Help section here](https://help.github.com/en/desktop). If you wish to contribute directly through GitHub, please see the relevant section below.*

2. Clone the forked repository
    * Log into your GitHub account in GitHub Desktop. On the home screen, you will see a list of your repositories. Select the forked repo, and then click `Clone <yourusername>/SCPSL-Translations` - doing so will download the repo onto your computer.

3. Open a file and edit/add what you want to change with a text editor
4. Once all desired changes have been made, run `EncodingNormalizer.exe` on the modified files
    * `EncodingNormalizer.exe` is an application which ensures correct encoding and formatting of translation files. **Please use this before submitting your Pull Request.**
    * `EncodingNormalizer.exe` only needs to be run on the files that have been modified. These files can be selected by clicking 'Choose File' and selecting the desired file(s) or directory.
5. Commit the modified files
   * Please include a meaningful commit describing exact changes that were made. This is helpful to us when reviewing Pull Requests and commit history.
    * __Only__ commit changes to files you've added/edited. **Don't** commit changes to `English (default)`
   - Usually most GUI clients, such as GitHub desktop will only commit modified files. 
6. Push your commit(s) to GitHub
    * When changes are committed, only the files on disk (i.e. in the *cloned* repo) are modified. By pushing these commits, these changes are also reflected in the forked repository on GitHub. This is necessary for the next step:
7. Open a Pull Request (see below). Studio staff will review the translation.
